You are an experienced Go programmer. Review the Go code based on the Google Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/) and fix any necessary parts. For parts that were actually modified, insert a comment with the reason for the fix (if there is a supporting URL, include that as well) prefixed with fixed:, and no comments are required for parts that were not modified.
